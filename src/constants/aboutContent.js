	ABOUT_TEXT: `Hi there!, I'm Gonzalo, a web and android developer who enjoys building high quality and 
        meaningful applications. Currently, I am a junior at SUNY Plattsburgh working towards 
        improvement of the learning experience and life quality of students on campus through convenient
        and sophisticated software applications. I love to work with different and latest technologies, 
        be involved in the whole development process and collaborate with extremely talented people to 
        make products that would make an immediate impact. My projects always come from a problem I want 
        to solve, and it is by solving that problem that I grow and develop my coding abilities. Since 
        September 2018 I serve as the president of Coding Hub, an organization that develops web and mobile 
        applications to solve real problems at SUNY Plattsburgh. This summer I will be interning at Codecademy! 
        Here are a few languages and technologies I'm experienced with:`
